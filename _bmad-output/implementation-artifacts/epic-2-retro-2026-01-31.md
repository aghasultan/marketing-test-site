## Review Discussion

### 🏆 What Went Well
- **Code-as-CMS Strategy:** Story 2.1's decision to use a strictly typed local JSON (`src/data/results.ts`) instead of an external CMS proved excellent for velocity. It allows instant loads and type-safe content management.
- **Radix UI Integration:** Continuing the pattern from Epic 1, using `@radix-ui/react-dialog` for the details modal (Story 2.4) ensured accessibility compliance without complex custom logic.
- **Performance:** Client-side filtering (Story 2.3) is instantaneous, providing a snappy user experience.

### 🚧 Challenges
- **Modal Context:** Preserving the exact scroll position and filter state when closing the modal required careful state management, but was successfully implemented.
- **Documentation Drift:** The issue with "File Lists" in story artifacts not matching actual git state persisted into Story 2.4 (Code Review finding). The "Git Sync Check" process from Epic 1 needs stricter enforcement.

### 💡 Key Insights
- **Type Safety is Documentation:** The strict interfaces defined in Story 2.1 act as live documentation for the data model, making it easy for any dev to add new case studies.

## Commitments & Action Items

### Action Items
1.  **[Content] Backfill Case Studies:** We have the structure, now we need real data. (Owner: Marketing/PO)
2.  **[Tech] Image Optimization:** Ensure images referenced in `results.ts` are optimized in `/public` to maintain LCP scores. (Owner: Dev)

## Readiness Assessment
**Epic 2 is DONE.** The core "Proof" section of the site is fully functional.
