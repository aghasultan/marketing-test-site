## Epic Summary
| Metric | Value | Notes |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Stories** | 3/3 | 100% Complete |
| **Duration** | 1 Sprint | |
| **Blockers** | 1 | Browser timeout (Resolved) |
| **Key Output** | Responsive Header, Mobile Drawer, Smooth Scroll |

## Review Discussion

### 🏆 What Went Well
- **Shadcn/UI Adoption:** Using the `Sheet` primitive for the Mobile Drawer was a huge win. It provided accessibility features (focus trap, ARIA) out of the box, saving estimated 4-6 hours of dev time.
- **CSS-First Architecture:** Implementing "Smooth Scroll" via CSS (`scroll-behavior: smooth`) rather than JS libraries kept the bundle size small and performance high.
- **Design Impact:** The "Glassmorphism" effect (Story 1.1, 1.2) successfully established the premium "Technical Dark Mode" brand aesthetic early.

### 🚧 Challenges
- **Playwright Flakiness:** Story 1.2 saw some flaky tests regarding desktop header visibility when the mobile drawer was active.
- **Git State Sync:** Minor friction with file list updates in `dev-story` artifacts not matching actual git state, requiring manual "AI-Review" correction.

### 💡 Key Insights
- **Primitives > Custom:** Lean on Shadcn/Radix primitives for complex interactive components (Modals, Drawers).
- **Verify Git State:** Always double-check `git status` before finalizing a story artifact to ensure the "File List" is accurate.

## Commitments & Action Items

### Action Items
1.  **[Process] Standardize Shadcn Import:** When needing a new UI component, check Shadcn registry first. (Owner: Dev Team)
2.  **[Tech] Stabilize E2E Tests:** Investigate and fix flaky desktop visibility test in `tests/header.spec.ts`. (Owner: QA/Dana)
3.  **[Process] Git Sync Check:** Add a manual "Git Status Verify" step to the `dev-story` workflow. (Owner: SM/Bob)

### Epic 2 Preparation
**Epic 2: Results Engine & Trust Building**
- **Focus:** Data visualization (Grid), Logic (Filters), and Content (Markdown).
- **Prerequisites:** `src/data/results.ts` schema definition is critical (Story 2.1).
- **Risk:** Complexity in "Instant Filtering" state management.

## Readiness Assessment
**Epic 1 is DONE.** The navigation foundation is solid. The team is ready to move to **Epic 2**.
