# Retrospective - Epic 3: Smart Application Wizard

**Date:** 2026-01-31
**Participants:** Bob (SM), Alice (PO), Technical Team

## Epic Summary
| Metric | Value | Notes |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Stories** | 4/4 | 100% Complete |
| **Duration** | 1 Sprint | |
| **Key Output** | Multi-step Zod-validated Form, Conditional Logic, Review Step |

## Review Discussion

### 🏆 What Went Well
- **State Architecture:** Leveraging `react-hook-form` combined with a custom hook (`useApplyForm`) allowed for clean separation of validation logic (Zod) and UI state. Data persistence between steps works flawlessly.
- **User Experience:** The Framer Motion transitions (Story 3.3) add a high level of polish that distinguishes the app from standard utilitarian forms.
- **Branching Logic:** The conditional flow (Ads vs Analytics) was implemented robustly, simplifying the user journey by hiding irrelevant questions.

### 🚧 Challenges
- **Schema Complexity:** Handling conditional validation (e.g., requiring `customIndustry` only if `industry === 'Other'`) required careful Zod refinement (Story 3.2).
- **Review Step:** Mapping the raw form data back to readable labels for the Review step (Story 3.4) needed manual mapping tables, which might be a maintenance burden long-term.

### 💡 Key Insights
- **Hoisting is Key:** Hoisting the form state to the parent `Apply.tsx` (or context) was essential. Standard route-based wizards often lose state on navigation; our memory-based approach feels faster and safer.

## Commitments & Action Items

### Action Items
1.  **[Tech] Schema/UI Sync:** Ensure `types.ts` (Zod schema) is the single source of truth for options lists to avoid drift between validation and dropdown UI. (Owner: Dev)
2.  **[Testing] Edge Cases:** Add more test coverage for the "Back" button navigation to ensure it never clears data unexpectedly. (Owner: QA)

## Readiness Assessment
**Epic 3 is DONE.** The lead qualification engine is robust and ready for traffic.
