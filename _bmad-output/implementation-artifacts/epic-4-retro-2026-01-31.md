# Retrospective - Epic 4: Content & SEO Polish

**Date:** 2026-01-31
**Participants:** Bob (SM), Alice (PO), Technical Team

## Epic Summary
| Metric | Value | Notes |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Stories** | 3/3 | 100% Complete |
| **Duration** | 0.5 Sprint | Fast follow-up to Epics 2 & 3 |
| **Key Output** | Unified Design System (Glassmorphism), JSON-LD Schema |

## Review Discussion

### 🏆 What Went Well
- **Design Unification:** Refactoring the Home and Scale pages (Story 4.1, 4.2) to match the "Glassmorphism" aesthetic defined in earlier epics brought the whole application together visually. It no longer looks like a "Frankenstein" of old and new code.
- **SEO Implementation:** The decision to inject JSON-LD via `react-helmet` (Story 4.3) was clean and minimally invasive, providing high value for low effort.

### 🚧 Challenges
- **CSS Migration:** Removing the old BEM classes and `index.css` rules required careful regression testing to ensure no layout breakages occurred on mobile devices.

### 💡 Key Insights
- **Utility-First is Faster:** Once the Tailwind config (colors, spacing) was locked in, refactoring the legacy pages was significantly faster than writing custom CSS would have been.

## Commitments & Action Items

### Action Items
1.  **[Cleanup] Remove Legacy CSS:** Now that the refactor is done, do a final sweep of `index.css` to delete unused custom classes. (Owner: Dev)
2.  **[Validation] Rich Snippets Test:** Manually run the deployed site through Google's Rich Results Test to verify the JSON-LD. (Owner: SEO/Marketing)

## Readiness Assessment
**Epic 4 is DONE.** The implementation phase of the project is effectively complete.
