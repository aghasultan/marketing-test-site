# Story 5.4: Deployment Pipeline & Documentation

## Rationale
To ensure a smooth launch and long-term maintainability, we must document the deployment process and configure production safeguards.

## Tasks
- [x] 1. Vercel Configuration
    - Created `vercel.json` with strict security headers (Frame Options, CSP, HSTS).
    - Configured caching strategies for assets vs HTML.
- [x] 2. Deployment Checklist
    - Updated `docs/deployment-guide.md` with build pipeline details.
- [x] 3. Handoff Documentation
    - Updated `README.md` with content editing and testing instructions.
