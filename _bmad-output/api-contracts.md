# API Contracts

**Status:** No internal API layer detected.

## Overview
The application appears to be a client-side Single Page Application (SPA).
- **Internal APIs:** None detected in `src/api` or `src/server`.
- **External Integrations:** Likely uses direct calls to external services or mock data for the Audit Engine.

## Recommendations
- If backend services are added (e.g. via Next.js API routes or Express), document them here.
- If using 3rd party APIs (e.g., Stripe, CMS), list their integration points here.
