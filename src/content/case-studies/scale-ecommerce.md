# The Challenge

The client was stuck at $500k/mo with a degrading ROAS on Facebook. Creative fatigue was high.

# The Solution

We implemented the "Velvet Rope" creative strategy, testing 50+ hooks per week on TikTok, and synchronized the data via server-side tracking (CAPI) to train the pixel faster.

# The Result

Within 60 days, we doubled the revenue while maintaining profitability.
