## The Challenge
Gameday Men's Health had a proven offer but struggled to scale lead generation beyond their local referral network. CPA was rising as they increased spend.

## The Strategy
We implemented a full-funnel strategy:
1. **Creative Testing**: Launched 50+ UGC variations to find winning hooks.
2. **Landing Page Optimization**: Simplified the booking flow, increasing conversion rate by 40%.
3. **Server-Side Tracking**: Implemented CAPI to recapture 20% of lost signal.

## The Results
Within 6 months, we scaled monthly revenue from $50k to over $300k, maintaining a 4x ROAS.
