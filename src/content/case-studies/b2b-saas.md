# The Challenge

High CPL and low intent leads from broad matching keywords.

# The Solution

We restricted match types to Phrase and Exact, implemented offline conversion tracking (OCT) to optimize for SQLs rather than just leads, and redesigned the landing page for trust.

# The Result

Lead volume tripled while the cost per lead dropped significantly. Pipeline value increased by $2M.
