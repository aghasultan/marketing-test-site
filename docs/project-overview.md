# Project Overview

## Riffat Labs Marketing Site

A modern, high-performance marketing portfolio and utility site for **Riffat Labs**. It serves as both a showcase of services and a lead generation tool via an interactive "Agency Audit" feature.

## Key Goals
- **Lead Generation**: Convert visitors through the "Apply" wizard and "Agency Audit" tools.
- **Authority Building**: Showcase case studies and results using data-rich visualizations.
- **Performance**: Deliver a fast, tracked experience using modern web tech.

## Technical Summary
- **Type**: Monolith Web Application
- **Stack**: React, Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Repository**: Single repository structure

## Architecture
The project is architected as a **Component-Based SPA**. It emphasizes visual fidelity (animations, glassmorphism) while maintaining strict TypeScript type safety. Feature logic is co-located in `src/features/` where possible to avoid a cluttered global scope.
